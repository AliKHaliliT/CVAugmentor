How to read the tests: S/S/R (Subject, Scenario, Result)


Read ->
```
When,
Testing subject,
Given some input/act/...,
We should get some output.
```

Example: 
test_activation_wrong__value_value__error: test is a default prefix. So this test would read:

When,
Testing activation,
Given a wrong value,
We should get a value error.
